## Security

I take the security of my software products and services seriously, which includes all source code repositories managed through my GitHub organizations.

I follow the MITRE.org definition of a security vulnerability which defines a security vulnerability as “a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, OR availability. Mitigation of the vulnerabilities in this context typically involves coding changes but could also include specification changes or even specification deprecations (e.g., removal of affected protocols or functionality in their entirety).” MITRE.org CNA Rules  7.1

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any of my repositories that meets the above definition of a security vulnerability, please report it as described below.

## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them to my email at [security@lara.monster](mailto:security@lara.monster).  If possible, encrypt your message with my PGP key; please download it from the [OpenPGP KeyServer](https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=81D47E3F9532443C7FB434FC09C07175CDDA832C++).

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

  * Type of issue
  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
  * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
  * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help me triage your report more quickly.

## Preferred Languages

I prefer all communications to be in English.

## Policy

I follow the principle of Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure. Under the principle of CVD, researchers disclose newly discovered vulnerabilities in hardware, software, and services directly to the vendors of the affected product; to a national CERT or other coordinator who will report to the vendor privately; or to a private service that will likewise report to the vendor privately. The researcher allows the vendor the opportunity to diagnose and offer fully tested updates, workarounds, or other corrective measures before any party discloses detailed vulnerability or exploit information to the public. The vendor continues to coordinate with the researcher throughout the vulnerability investigation and provides the researcher with updates on case progress. Upon release of an update, the vendor may recognize the finder for the research and privately reporting the issue. If attacks are underway in the wild, and the vendor is still working on the update, then both the researcher and vendor work together as closely as possible to provide early public vulnerability disclosure to protect customers. The aim is to provide timely and consistent guidance to customers to help them protect themselves.
